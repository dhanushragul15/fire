A Git repository is a version-controlled area to hold project files.
It keeps track of file changes over time so you can revert or compare versions.
Repositories may be local (on your machine) or remote (on sites such as GitHub).
You can make a repository with the command git init.
Changes to files are tracked as commits within the repository.
Git supports branching, making different versions of your project.
Branches may then be integrated back into the main project later.
Remote repositories facilitate collaboration using pushing and pulling changes.
Git repositories are required for code management and team collaboration.
They store a precise record of project modifications, enhancing workflow.
